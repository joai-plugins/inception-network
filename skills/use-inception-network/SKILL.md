# Inception Network

Connect Inception Network to Claude, Codex, and ChatGPT through JoAi's hosted MCP app server.

Use the MCP tools exposed by this plugin instead of describing the workflow abstractly. Start by identifying the most relevant action, then call the MCP tool directly.

## Example Prompts

- List the Inception Network tools available in this app.
- Explain what setup or authentication Inception Network needs before I run an action.
- Use Inception Network to help me with the task I describe next.

## Action Inventory

- `inception-network-claim-rewards` (contract) — Claim your eGold (EGLD) staking rewards from Inception Network.
- `inception-network-redelegate-egld` (contract) — Restake your eGold (EGLD) staking rewards with Inception Network.
- `inception-network-stake-egld` (contract, link) — Delegate your EGLD to Inception Network and earn staking rewards on MultiversX. Inception Network provides reliable validator infrastructure, helping you grow your eGold while securing the blockchain.
- `inception-network-undelegate-egld` (contract) — Unstake your eGold (EGLD) you have previously staked with Inception Network.

## Usage Notes

- Every listed action becomes an MCP tool when the app server is connected.
- Prefer the generated provider plugin when one is available, and fall back to the raw MCP URL otherwise.

## Auth Notes

- Some actions require provider credentials or OAuth on first use.
